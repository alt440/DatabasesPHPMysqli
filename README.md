To run the project:

1) Install and open XAMPP and start both Apache and MySQL
2) Place all the project files in C:\xampp\htdocs
3) Open your browser and in the search bar type `localhost/` and include the file path of the .php file you want to run (note: htdocs is seen as the root here, so only include files and folders after, it is not necessary to write C:/xampp/htdocs... For this project, you only need to write 'localhost/COMP353_P1.php' to make it work.)
4) Press enter and your php file will execute
5) (After execution of COMP353_P1.php) Now, if you go to 'localhost/phpmyadmin', you will see a new database called comp353 with the different tables required for the assignment and the information these tables contain.
