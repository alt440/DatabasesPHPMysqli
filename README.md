To run the project:

1) Install and open XAMPP and start both Apache and MySQL
2) Place all the project files in C:\xampp\htdocs
3) Open your browser and in the search bar type `localhost/` and include the file path of the .php file you want to run (note: htdocs is seen as the root here, so only include files and folders after, it is not necessary to write C:/xampp/... etc.)
4) Press enter and all should be good :)
